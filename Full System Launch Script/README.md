In order to use this script to launch the demo, make sure you have appropriately sourced your vector_ws. I recommend including the following lines in your bashrc:

	source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash
	
	source ~/vector_ws/devel/setup.bash

To find your bashrc, enter the following command into your console:

	cd
	vi .bashrc

Then add the source-ing lines at the end of file.

If you already have completed the above steps, place the script in your HOME folder or Desktop. To run, type into the console:

	./run_senior_design_sim.sh
