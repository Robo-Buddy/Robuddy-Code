Test 4: Four Corners
===

This test is a basic test to make sure that the simulation behaves properly when navigating across the floor. It uses points located at each corner of the map to make it traverse the full layout.

The points used in order, based on their position in the full points listing (0-indexed into the robuddy_goals.txt file):
1. Point 1 (Table 1, Bottom right)
2. Point 3 (Table 3, Top right)
3. Point 8 (Table 8, Bottom left)
4. Point 11 (Table 11, Top left)
