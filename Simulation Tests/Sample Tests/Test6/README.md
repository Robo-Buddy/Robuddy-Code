Test 6: Full Test
===

This test is a basic test to make sure that the simulation behaves properly when navigating between all of the goal points.

The points are used in order, based on their position in the full points listing (0-indexed into the robuddy_goals.txt file). See the top level README of the [Simulation Tests](../../) folder
