Instructions for testing:

Each test is contained within a folder. Each folder contains a goals.txt file, and a README explaining the test. Results of running the test are included in the README as well.

General Testing Instrutions:
---
Run each sample test a number of times (approximatly 10 to 20 based on the complexity and the tester's patience). Record the total number of tests in the README, and the number of successes. Note any details or interesting notes about the tests (common errors, common patterns, etc.).
