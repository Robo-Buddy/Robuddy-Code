Test 7: Explicit Full Test
===

This test is a comprehensive test to make sure that the simulation behaves properly when navigating between each of the goal points and the store room.

The points are used in order, based on their position in the full points listing (0-indexed into the robuddy_goals.txt file), as with Test 6. The difference here is that a copy of the Store Room Point (point 0) is interjected in between each point. See the top level README of the [Simulation Tests](../../) folder
