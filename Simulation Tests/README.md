This folder contains the 3D models of the Longhorn Maker Studios in the new EERC building, and some test cases for the gazebo simulation.


LMS Models and Floor Plans
===
The [LMS Models and Floor Plans](./LMS\ Models\ and\ Floor\ Plans) folder has a few of the model files and the floor plans. The floor plan used as a base for the gazebo simulation is the cropped version of the ground floor layout.


Goals_README and robuddy_goals
===
The [Goals_README.png](./Goals_README.png) file contains an edited image of this floor plan, where all of our established goal points are labeled based upon the order of the points in the [robuddy_goals.txt](./robuddy_goals.txt) file. This text file is the standard "goals.txt" in the simulation.


Sample Tests
===
The [Sample Tests](./Sample\ Tests) contains multiple variations on the goals.txt file, each of which test a subset of points from the main goals file. These are used for testing the success of our simulation before we move our code onto the robot itself.

For each test case, there is a points file and a readme file sharing the same name. The points file is a listing of goal points to test, and the readme explains the purpose of the test and the results of multiple runs of the test along with our notes.
